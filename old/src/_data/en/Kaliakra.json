      "heading": "Tips for Visitors",
      "content": "Bring high SPF sunscreen (30+) as the sun is strong. Many beach vendors prefer cash. Learning a few Bulgarian phrases is appreciated. Book accommodations in advance for July-August. Consider renting a car to explore multiple beaches. Try local restaurants for authentic Bulgarian cuisine and fresh Black Sea fish. Beach umbrellas and sunbeds are available but bringing your own gear saves money."
