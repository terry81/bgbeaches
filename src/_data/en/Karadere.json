      "content": "Karadere is defined by its **complete lack of commercial infrastructure**—no hotels, no resorts, no restaurants, no sunbeds, and **no mobile phone service**. This has preserved its status as a haven for:\n* **Free Camping:** A long-standing tradition attracting self-sufficient travelers, artists, and families who pitch **tents** among the sand dunes and forest line.\n* **Authentic Nature:** Fine, clean sand, crystal-clear water, spring water, and even natural mud baths.\n* **Alternative Tourism:** A popular spot for **nudism/clothing-optional** sunbathing and a **bohemian, eco-conscious** crowd."

      "heading": "Visitor Experience and Safety ⚠️",
      "content": "Visiting Karadere requires self-sufficiency: you must bring all food, water, and waste removal supplies. Access is via **bumpy, difficult dirt roads**. The beach is **unsupervised** (no lifeguards), and while the sea is generally calm, strong currents or high waves can occur. Its wildness is its greatest draw, but also its greatest challenge."
