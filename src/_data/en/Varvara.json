The main beach, though small, is the most accessible. Many of the other coves require a **difficult descent** and offer no amenities, hence they are often deserted. The clear Black Sea waters are warm for swimming during summer, but swimming safety should be considered near rocks."

Given the limited commercial amenities, visitors should be prepared to bring essentials like cash, high SPF sunscreen, and comfortable footwear for rocky terrain."
