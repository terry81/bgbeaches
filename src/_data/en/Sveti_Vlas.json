It is renowned for its modern, luxurious **Marina Dinevi**, which attracts high-end yachting tourism. Its location at the foot of the Balkan Mountains creates a favorable **microclimate**—cleaner air and protection from strong winds—making it popular for those seeking therapeutic benefits. However, visitors must be aware of the trade-offs: the resort is **highly urbanized, crowded, and known for its small beaches**."

      "heading": "Beaches and Coastal Conditions",
      "content": "The key characteristic of Sveti Vlas is the **limited beach space**. The beaches are sandy but **small and fragmented** by the development, and often become very crowded during peak season. Water temperatures are typically 22-25 degrees in summer. While the beaches offer standard amenities (sunbeds/umbrellas), space is a premium. The coastal focus here is arguably more on the **Marina's atmosphere and amenities** than on expansive beach leisure."

A major factor for travelers is the **ongoing, widespread construction**. The town is still heavily developing, which means visitors may encounter construction noise and unfinished sites, reflecting its rapid, sometimes unchecked, urbanization."
