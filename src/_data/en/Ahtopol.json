What to Bring: While umbrellas are available for rent, bringing your own beach mat, sunscreen (SPF 30+ recommended), and water is advisable. The nearest shops are about 200 meters from the beach entrance. Safety: The shallow waters and lifeguard presence make this a very safe beach for families. However, be aware of occasional jellyfish during late summer months. Costs: Beach access is free. Expect to spend 10-15 BGN for sunbed rental, 5-10 BGN for drinks and snacks at beach bars. Best For: Families with children, couples seeking relaxation, older travelers, and anyone looking to escape overcrowded tourist beaches."
