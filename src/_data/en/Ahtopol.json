However, be aware of occasional jellyfish during late summer months. Costs: Beach access is free. Expect to spend 10-15 BGN for sunbed rental, 5-10 BGN for drinks and snacks at beach bars. Best For: Families with children, couples seeking relaxation, older travelers, and anyone looking to escape overcrowded tourist beaches."
