The main visitor activities are based on the **plateau above the cliffs**:\n* **Free Camping:** The open fields are popular for free camping, attracting a bohemian crowd.\n* **Sunrise Views:** The eastern exposure offers spectacular, unobstructed sunrises, especially for the famous **'July Morning'** celebration (greeting the first sunrise of July).\n* **Hiking and Nature:** The coastal area offers rugged **hiking trails** and opportunities for **birdwatching** and appreciating the raw geology."

Visitors must be self-sufficient.\n* **Safety:** **Extreme caution** must be used near the cliff edges due to strong winds and erosion. Avoid descending the cliffs outside of marked, official access points.\n* **Vibe:** **Alternative, rustic, bohemian, and quiet**, offering a powerful connection to nature far from resorts like Golden Sands or Sunny Beach."
