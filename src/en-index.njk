What you see here is a precious photographic archive from that journey – authentic snapshots of Bulgarian coastal beauty before many changes occurred.</p>

<div class="info-box warning">
  <p><strong>⚠️ Conservation Note:</strong> Unfortunately, many Bulgarian beaches have suffered from uncontrolled development and environmental neglect. Some of our photos serve as memories of beauty that has since been impacted by reckless construction. We hope this archive raises awareness about the importance of coastal preservation.</p>
