<h2>About This Project</h2>
<p align="justify">Bulgarian Beaches is a comprehensive photographic documentation of Bulgaria's Black Sea coastline, created in 2007 by two friends with a passion for travel, photography, and coastal conservation.</p>
<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p align="justify">During the summer of 2007, my great friend Peter and I decided to travel around Bulgaria's entire Black Sea coast, document every major beach destination, and create a comprehensive online guide. We spent weeks exploring the 378-kilometer coastline from Durankulak in the north to Rezovo in the south.</p>
<h2>What We Documented</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>46 Beach Locations</strong> - Every major destination along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast</li>
  <li><strong>Hundreds of Photographs</strong> - Authentic, unedited images showing real conditions</li>
  <li><strong>Detailed Descriptions</strong> - Practical information, historical context, and honest assessments</li>
</ul>
<h2>Contact Information</h2>
