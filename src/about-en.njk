  <h2>📖 About This Project</h2>
  <p>A comprehensive photographic documentation of Bulgaria's Black Sea coastline, created in 2007 by two friends with a passion for travel, photography, and coastal conservation.</p>
</div>

<h2>Our Story</h2>
<p>During the summer of 2007, my great friend Peter and I decided to embark on an ambitious journey: to travel around Bulgaria's entire Black Sea coast, document every major beach destination, and create a comprehensive online guide that would help travelers discover the beauty of Bulgarian beaches.</p>

<p>We spent weeks exploring the 378-kilometer coastline from Durankulak in the north to Rezovo in the south. Armed with cameras and a sense of adventure, we visited 46 distinct beach locations, capturing thousands of photographs and gathering firsthand information about each destination.</p>

<h2>What We Documented</h2>

<div class="content-card">
  <h3>🏖️ 46 Beach Locations</h3>
  <p>Every major destination along the Bulgarian Black Sea coast, from popular resorts like Sunny Beach and Golden Sands to hidden gems like Silistar and Sinemorets. Each location has been photographed and described in detail.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-card">
  <h3>📸 Hundreds of Photographs</h3>
  <p>Authentic, unedited images showing real conditions as we found them in 2007. These photographs serve as a historical record of the Bulgarian coastline, many capturing beauty that has since been impacted by development.</p>
</div>

<div class="content-card">
  <h3>📝 Detailed Descriptions</h3>
  <p>Practical information, historical context, and honest assessments for each location. We share both the highlights and the concerns we observed during our journey.</p>
</div>

<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>This project was born from a deep love for Bulgaria's natural coastal beauty and a concern about its preservation. While we fully support the development of tourism – a vital part of Bulgaria's economy – we believe it must be done responsibly and sustainably.</p>

<div class="info-box warning">
  <p><strong>⚠️ Conservation Awareness:</strong> Many of the photographs on this site now serve as memories of beauty that has been lost to uncontrolled development. We hope this archive raises awareness about the importance of protecting what remains of Bulgaria's pristine coastline.</p>
</div>

<h2>Why This Archive Matters</h2>
<p>Since 2007, the Bulgarian Black Sea coast has undergone significant changes. Some positive, many negative. Our photographs capture a moment in time – before some of the most dramatic transformations occurred. For researchers, conservationists, and anyone interested in the history of Bulgarian coastal development, this archive provides valuable documentation.</p>
