    <p align="justify">IYC is a destination along Bulgaria&#39;s beautiful Black Sea coast. This destination features Sandy beach, Bulgarian coastal atmosphere, summer facilities, making it ideal for beach lovers, families, travelers seeking authentic Bulgarian coast. The Bulgarian Black Sea coast offers 378 kilometers of diverse beaches, and IYC provides its own unique character and attractions.</p>

    <p align="justify">The beach area at IYC features fine to medium sand typical of Black Sea beaches. During summer months (June-September), water temperatures range from 22-25°C (72-77°F), perfect for swimming. The area offers standard beach amenities including umbrella and sunbed rentals (typically 10-20 BGN per day), changing facilities, and food services. Peak season runs from mid-July through mid-August, when the beaches are busiest and prices highest.</p>
  
    <h2>Getting There &amp; Practical Information</h2>
    <p align="justify">The nearest airports are Burgas (BOJ) and Varna (VAR), both serving international and domestic flights. Bus services connect major coastal towns during summer. Accommodation ranges from budget guesthouses (40-60 BGN/night) to mid-range hotels (80-150 BGN/night). Bulgaria uses the Bulgarian Lev (BGN), approximately 2 BGN = 1 EUR. English is commonly spoken in tourist areas.</p>

    <h2>Tips for Visitors</h2>
