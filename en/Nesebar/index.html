    <h2>About Nesebar</h2>
    <p align="justify">Nesebar is UNESCO World Heritage ancient town on a peninsula. This destination features Medieval churches, cobblestone streets, beaches, restaurants, traditional architecture, making it ideal for history buffs, culture seekers, photography enthusiasts. The Bulgarian Black Sea coast offers 378 kilometers of diverse beaches, and Nesebar provides its own unique character and attractions.</p>
  
    <h2>What to Expect</h2>
    <p align="justify">The beach area at Nesebar features fine to medium sand typical of Black Sea beaches. During summer months (June-September), water temperatures range from 22-25°C (72-77°F), perfect for swimming. The area offers standard beach amenities including umbrella and sunbed rentals (typically 10-20 BGN per day), changing facilities, and food services. Peak season runs from mid-July through mid-August, when the beaches are busiest and prices highest.</p>
  
    <h2>Getting There &amp; Practical Information</h2>
    <p align="justify">The nearest airports are Burgas (BOJ) and Varna (VAR), both serving international and domestic flights. Bus services connect major coastal towns during summer. Accommodation ranges from budget guesthouses (40-60 BGN/night) to mid-range hotels (80-150 BGN/night). Bulgaria uses the Bulgarian Lev (BGN), approximately 2 BGN = 1 EUR. English is commonly spoken in tourist areas.</p>
  
    <h2>Nearby Attractions</h2>
    <p align="justify">Beyond the beach, visitors can explore old town, archaeological sites, Sunny Beach resort. The Bulgarian coast combines natural beauty with historical sites, traditional villages, and opportunities for hiking, water sports, and cultural experiences. Each location offers something unique while maintaining authentic Bulgarian coastal character.</p>
  
    <h2>Best Time to Visit</h2>
    <p align="justify">June and September offer excellent weather with fewer crowds and better prices compared to peak July-August. Water is warm enough for comfortable swimming from mid-June through mid-September. For the quietest experience and best value, consider late May or early October, though some facilities may have reduced hours.</p>
  
    <h2>Tips for Visitors</h2>
    <p align="justify">Bring high SPF sunscreen (30+) as the sun is strong. Many beach vendors prefer cash. Learning a few Bulgarian phrases is appreciated. Book accommodations in advance for July-August. Consider renting a car to explore multiple beaches. Try local restaurants for authentic Bulgarian cuisine and fresh Black Sea fish. Beach umbrellas and sunbeds are available but bringing your own gear saves money.</p>
