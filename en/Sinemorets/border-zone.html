     alt="This is the bridge right before the Sinemorets village. Here begins the Border zone with Turkey. In the past, it has been forbidden to pass this line unless you have good reasons :) This has preserved the place from the tourist invasion. Unfortunately the ban has been lifted with the fall of Communism and tourists have invaded this territory too."
