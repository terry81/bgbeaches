     alt="This is the road you are not supposed to follow. After wandering for hours in the forest, we have come a few times to signs such as exit forbidden... This is the reserve just above the Pearl where the former communist leaders went hunting. We ourselves saw quite a lot wild animals. And it is really scary... Especially in the late evening when besides the wild animals there are some wild people with SUVs hunting ... may be you :)"
