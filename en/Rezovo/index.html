During summer months (June-September), water temperatures range from 22-25°C (72-77°F), perfect for swimming. The area offers standard beach amenities including umbrella and sunbed rentals (typically 10-20 BGN per day), changing facilities, and food services. Peak season runs from mid-July through mid-August, when the beaches are busiest and prices highest.</p>
  
    <h2>Getting There &amp; Practical Information</h2>

Accommodation ranges from budget guesthouses (40-60 BGN/night) to mid-range hotels (80-150 BGN/night). Bulgaria uses the Bulgarian Lev (BGN), approximately 2 BGN = 1 EUR.
